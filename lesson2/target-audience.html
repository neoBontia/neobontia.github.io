            <p>Weather with us targets those that are dependant on the weather. These may be those that work outside,
               those that plan to travel, those that are planning activities outside, or could even be for those that
               want to study the weather. However, based on the website design, Weather with us only accomodates those
               that lives within Preston, Soda Springs, or Fish Haven, Idaho. The website is also designed to accomodate
               mobile and desktop view.

                    <li>It has been raining for a whole day now and Jhobell is worried if a storm is coming so that she can advise
                        her class if classes would be suspended because of the storm.
                    </li>
                    <li>Jhobell usually commutes to go to school. As a teacher, she prepares a lot of visual aids so her hands are
                        always full. As much as possible, she wants to refrain from bringing an umbrella to free up her hands or her
                        bag. If she knew when it would rain, it would be easier for to decide to bring an umbrella or not.
                    </li>
                    <li>Jhobell plans to buy groceries for the whole week. She plans to cook hot dishes on rainy days so that her
                        children will not feel so cold during the rain.
