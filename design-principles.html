                Visual Heirarchy was used on this page to showcase Dungeons & Dragons' new handbook.
                Displaying the cover page of the manual attracts the eyes of its viewers and the large
                font that displays the manual's name solidifies the attention of the viewer. The 'Learn
                More' button then enticies the viewer to interact with it.

                Calendly's website design is so simple that looks clean and user-friendly. Calendly would
                want to sell their product as a professional yet easy-to-use scheduling application, and
                the way its site is design sure sells their product that way.

                Before choosing which restaurant to order food from, it is easier to know which food you would
                want to eat. There are a plethora of varieties of food and that makes it usually hard to choose
                what you would like to it. By adding a filter system of which food one would like to eat, it
                becomes less work for the user to choose.
